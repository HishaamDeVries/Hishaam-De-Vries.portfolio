                Hishaam, one of the most talented individuals I've ever
                encountered. With extreme determination , he make sure that he
                completes his task and that it's 100% proper. Very hardworking
                as well , very often working through the night as I have

                Hishaam is a tech enthusiast in every sense of the word. His
                interest in technology includes both software and hardware. He
                is interested in the software running on the computer as much as
                he is interested in the computer running the software so he is
                an all rounder asset to have. He does not only stick to the bare
                minimum of a task but goes the extra of adding the best extra
                features to a project. His skill of meeting deadlines is also
                something to commend. I would definitely recommend him to any
                team.
